The written report produced by your team is central to this project. This will detail how you completed your project, and should cover data collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies, descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We anticipate that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the reasons for them should be documented! You will write one report document per group, and be sure to include all group member names in the document.

Your report should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.

* Studying at Columbia University, except enjoying fascinating school life, we should always be concerned about the safety problem. Frequent email alerts, Citizen apps popping up, and terrifying news, they are all reminding us that there are many underlying unsafe factors around us. The New York government has made a public crime map at https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/.
The information in it, however, is way too redundant for a student as we are more concerned about the safety conditions around our campus and our places of residence. Luckily, NYPD has posted the up-to-date dataset that includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department, and it includes more information that we are interested in, for example, the time of occurrence of the complaint, the victimâ€™s statistics. After analyzing the dataset, we can have a more comprehensive understanding about the crimes around us. Finally, we want to draw a fine map locating the crime incidents around our campus, informing us what time may be more dangerous and we can avoid activities at that time. The map will give students the option of looking up when they travel most often to help them more accurately determine the likelihood of danger. We also want this result to help all the staff and students in Columbia University have an opportunity to evaluate the risk, avoid the danger, and allow them to access crime rates in the areas they care about to keep themselves safe.

Related work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.

* When we were looking for information about the crime rate near Columbia University, we saw the paper "Columbia stabbing puts spotlight on school's poor crime, safety record" which talked about some crimes in New York City. It inspired us to research more about the crime near Columbia University such as where and when the crime rate is higher and then we can try to avoid dangerous places to avoid being hurt. Besides some introduction to crime, there is also a pie chart in the paper, which makes us know the proportion of some types of criminal events directly. But this pie chart only provides a general summary of criminal events, and we think there are many details that can be added. Therefore, we want to analyze the crime rate near Columbia University according to our data set, and give the distribution more intuitively through some plots. This is the link of the paper https://nypost.com/2021/12/04/columbia-grad-student-murder-puts-spotlight-on-crime-safety-record/.





Initial questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

Data: Source, scraping method, cleaning, etc.

Exploratory analysis: Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

Additional analysis: If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail
Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?
As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your report is a standalone document that fully describes your process and results. We also expect you to write high-quality code that is understandable to an outside reader. Coding collaboratively and actively reviewing code within the team will help with this!
